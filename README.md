<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This microservice is a part of a bigger project - ProgrammersOnlyApp. Our project’s sole purpose is to connect people like you - creative github users. Users with too many ideas and not enough people to execute them. Users with a need for open-source contributions. If you are a programmer, this is a place for you. 

On the other hand, this microservice is for storing your projects, ideas and everything that is connected to that. That way people you are looking for will be able to find you themselves!
